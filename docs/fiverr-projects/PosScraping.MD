Congratulations on installing Python on your brand new PC! This README file will guide you through the steps to run the main.py file.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your PC (you can check the version by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing python --version)
- A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your choice (e.g. Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)


## Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Open a command prompt or terminal on your PC and type the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.
## Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Open a file explorer and navigate to the directory where the main.py file is located. You can do this by typing the following command in the command prompt or terminal:

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  cd path/to/project/directory
```
Replace path/to/project/directory with the actual path to the directory where the main.py file is located.


## Step 3: Run the main.py File
Once you are in the project directory, type the following command to run the main.py file:

Open a file explorer and navigate to the directory where the main.py file is located. You can do this by typing the following command in the command prompt or terminal:

```bash
  python main.py
```
This will execute the main.py file and run the program.

## Step 4: Enter Date Input
After running the program, you will be prompted to enter a date range. Please enter the start in the format MM-DD-YYYY when prompted.
And select an option for order type

Example:

```bash
Enter start date (MM-DD-YYYY): 9-1-2024
